 Hey Kai, I reviewed you code. 


Week 1:

Problem 1: Your solution is very clean and written very methodically. Although it works for most test cases. It will fail if the list only contains 1 number as the list index will be out of range. 



Could shorten your solution down to a simple for loop:
  
  
  
    
      
      
        Python
      
    
    
    
      For digit in nums:
  if nums.count(digit) == 1:
  return digit
    
    
  
  

 

Problem 2: Really well written solution which is efficient and fast! Although you can reduce this code by quite a bit by using sets in Python. As sets can only contain unique entities. 



Tests: Very well written, good naming conventions and really like that you store the results. Helps with readability! 



Week 2:

Second largest: Nice and clean solution using built in functions. Like how you dealt with the removal of chars. 



Valid anagram: Clean solution, and you can do away with .join just returning like this would be adequate:  return sorted(s) == sorted(t)



Tests:  Good test coverage that covers some test cases will fail and pass. Really like the comments!
